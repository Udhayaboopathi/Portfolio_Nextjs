## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(45, 90%, 50%) - RGB(250, 210, 15) A vibrant yellow to convey creativity and energy, fitting for a modern and interactive portfolio.  This hue is very versatile and works well on light or dark backgrounds.
- Background color: HSL(45, 20%, 95%) - RGB(247, 245, 238) A very light, desaturated yellow to provide a bright and clean backdrop, ensuring readability and focus on content.
- Accent color: HSL(15, 90%, 45%) - RGB(230, 51, 0) An analogous hue to the primary color which provides excellent contrast to grab the user's attention and guide the eye without clashing, communicating intensity, determination, and focus on excellence.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy look.
- Use clean, outline-style icons for skills, projects, and navigation.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
